Key Points
Question  Is regular consumption of soft drinks associated with a greater risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality?

Findings  In this population-based cohort study of 451 743 individuals from 10 countries in Europe, greater consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality. Consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks was positively associated with deaths from circulatory diseases, and sugar-sweetened soft drinks were associated with deaths from digestive diseases.

Meaning  Results of this study appear to support ongoing public health measures to reduce the consumption of soft drinks.

Abstract
Importance  Soft drinks are frequently consumed, but whether this consumption is associated with mortality risk is unknown and has been understudied in European populations to date.

Objective  To examine the association between total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drink consumption and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This population-based cohort study involved participants (n = 451 743 of the full cohort) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an ongoing, large multinational cohort of people from 10 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), with participants recruited between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2000. Excluded participants were those who reported cancer, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes at baseline; those with implausible dietary intake data; and those with missing soft drink consumption or follow-up information. Data analyses were performed from February 1, 2018, to October 1, 2018.

Exposure  Consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Total mortality and cause-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for other mortality risk factors.

Results  In total, 521 330 individuals were enrolled. Of this total, 451 743 (86.7%) were included in the study, with a mean (SD) age of 50.8 (9.8) years and with 321 081 women (71.1%). During a mean (range) follow-up of 16.4 (11.1 in Greece to 19.2 in France) years, 41 693 deaths occurred. Higher all-cause mortality was found among participants who consumed 2 or more glasses per day (vs consumers of <1 glass per month) of total soft drinks (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.22; P < .001), sugar-sweetened soft drinks (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P = .004), and artificially sweetened soft drinks (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.35; P < .001). Positive associations were also observed between artificially sweetened soft drinks and deaths from circulatory diseases (≥2 glasses per day vs <1 glass per month; HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.30-1.78; P < .001) and between sugar-sweetened soft drinks and deaths from digestive diseases (≥1 glass per day vs <1 glass per month; HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.05; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance  This study found that consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks was positively associated with all-cause deaths in this large European cohort; the results are supportive of public health campaigns aimed at limiting the consumption of soft drinks.

Introduction
The frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks increases energy intake, which can lead to weight gain and obesity.1-3 In 2010, the worldwide burden of adiposity-associated cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and type 2 diabetes associated with consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks was estimated to be 184 000 deaths.4 Reformulation of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, in which sugar is replaced with low- or no-calorie sweeteners, is being driven by consumer awareness and fiscal instruments, such as taxes.5 Artificially sweetened soft drinks have few or no calories; however, their long-term physiological and health implications are largely unknown.6-8

Whether regular consumption of soft drinks (total, sugar-sweetened, or artificially sweetened) is associated with greater all-cause and cause-specific mortality is uncertain, given that inconsistent findings were reported from previous prospective studies.9,10 Recently, a joint analysis of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) reported that a higher level of consumption of sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages was associated with greater all-cause mortality in the United States.11 Similarly, a positive association between artificially sweetened beverage consumption and all-cause mortality among US-based women was also reported by the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study.12 Large-scale studies are required to examine the association between soft drink consumption and health outcomes, in particular research based in populations outside of the United States. To our knowledge, a large-scale European-based analysis of soft drink consumption and mortality outcomes has not been undertaken.

For cause-specific mortality, previous studies on soft drink consumption and cardiovascular disease mortality have found positive associations.11,13 However, whether these associations differed by type of circulatory diseases (eg, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases) is uncertain. Similarly, scant data are available to date on mortality from other major chronic conditions such as cancers, digestive diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.

We investigated the association of consuming total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks with total and cause-specific mortality among participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an ongoing, large multinational cohort with more than 41 000 recorded deaths reported during the follow-up period.
