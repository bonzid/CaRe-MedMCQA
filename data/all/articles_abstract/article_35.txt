Abstract

Background
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes considerable illness in older adults. The efficacy and safety of an investigational bivalent RSV prefusion F protein–based (RSVpreF) vaccine in this population are unknown.

Methods
In this ongoing, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults (≥60 years of age) to receive a single intramuscular injection of RSVpreF vaccine at a dose of 120 μg (RSV subgroups A and B, 60 μg each) or placebo. The two primary end points were vaccine efficacy against seasonal RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two or at least three signs or symptoms. The secondary end point was vaccine efficacy against RSV-associated acute respiratory illness.

Results
At the interim analysis (data-cutoff date, July 14, 2022), 34,284 participants had received RSVpreF vaccine (17,215 participants) or placebo (17,069 participants). RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with at least two signs or symptoms occurred in 11 participants in the vaccine group (1.19 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 33 participants in the placebo group (3.58 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) (vaccine efficacy, 66.7%; 96.66% confidence interval [CI], 28.8 to 85.8); 2 cases (0.22 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 14 cases (1.52 cases per 1000 person-years of observation), respectively, occurred with at least three signs or symptoms (vaccine efficacy, 85.7%; 96.66% CI, 32.0 to 98.7). RSV-associated acute respiratory illness occurred in 22 participants in the vaccine group (2.38 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) and 58 participants in the placebo group (6.30 cases per 1000 person-years of observation) (vaccine efficacy, 62.1%; 95% CI, 37.1 to 77.9). The incidence of local reactions was higher with vaccine (12%) than with placebo (7%); the incidences of systemic events were similar (27% and 26%, respectively). Similar rates of adverse events through 1 month after injection were reported (vaccine, 9.0%; placebo, 8.5%), with 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, considered by the investigators to be injection-related. Severe or life-threatening adverse events were reported in 0.5% of vaccine recipients and 0.4% of placebo recipients. Serious adverse events were reported in 2.3% of participants in each group through the data-cutoff date.

Conclusions
RSVpreF vaccine prevented RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness and RSV-associated acute respiratory illness in adults (≥60 years of age), without evident safety concerns. (Funded by Pfizer; RENOIR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05035212; EudraCT number, 2021-003693-31.)

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a common cause of lower respiratory tract illness worldwide, with a risk of severe illness among infants, young children, and older adults.1 The risk of severe RSV disease increases among older adults who are frail or have coexisting conditions.2 RSV illness develops in approximately 3 to 7% of healthy older adults in the United States and Europe each year, with an estimated 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths each year in the United States.3,4 The severity of illness among older adults who are hospitalized with RSV disease is substantial; 18% are admitted to an intensive care unit, 31% receive home health services at discharge, and 26% die within 1 year after admission.5 The diagnosis of RSV infection in adults is probably underestimated because, unlike the case with influenza, the reporting of RSV infections is not required by law in most jurisdictions, and testing, which is not routinely performed, may be unreliable.6,7 RSV shedding also occurs at higher levels and for a longer duration in older adults than in younger adults.8 Taken together, the overall RSV disease burden in older adults is high, and a vaccine to protect this population from RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness is an unmet medical need.
Despite more than 50 years of development, no RSV vaccine has been licensed.9 Challenges in development have included the lack of a precise protection correlate and poor immunogenicity of previous vaccine candidates.9,10 Development of protein-subunit vaccines has focused on the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, and the metastable prefusion form (preF) is a major target of the most potent virus neutralizing antibodies.11,12 Thus, stabilized preF is a key vaccine antigen.
The investigational bivalent RSV prefusion F protein−based (RSVpreF) vaccine contains stabilized prefusion F glycoproteins from the two major cocirculating antigenic subgroups (RSV A and RSV B).13,14 In phase 1–2 clinical studies, vaccination of adults with RSVpreF formulations at a 120-μg dose level substantially increased RSV neutralizing titers and had an acceptable safety and side-effect profile.15-17 In an RSV challenge study involving healthy persons who were 18 to 50 years of age, the vaccine efficacy was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54 to 96) against symptomatic RSV infection confirmed by any detectable viral RNA on at least 2 consecutive days.13 These safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data provided support for the advancement of RSVpreF vaccine to a pivotal phase 3 trial, RSV Vaccine Efficacy Study in Older Adults Immunized against RSV Disease (RENOIR), involving adults who were at least 60 years of age as well as to a phase 3 trial, Maternal Immunization Study for Safety and Efficacy (MATISSE),18 evaluating the efficacy and safety of maternal RSVpreF vaccination in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in infants. Here, we describe the results of an interim analysis of the RENOIR trial regarding the efficacy and safety of RSVpreF vaccine in the first RSV season after injection.
