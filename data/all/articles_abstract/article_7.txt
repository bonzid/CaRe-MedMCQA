Summary

Background
We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of dutasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor, on prostate cancer progression in men with low-risk disease who chose to be followed up with active surveillance.

Methods
In our 3 year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, undertaken at 65 academic medical centres or outpatient clinics in North America, we enrolled men aged 48–82 years who had low-volume, Gleason score 5–6 prostate cancer and had chosen to be followed up with active surveillance. We randomly allocated participants in a one-to-one ratio, stratified by site and in block sizes of four, to receive once-daily dutasteride 0·5 mg or matching placebo. Participants were followed up for 3 years, with 12-core prostate biopsy samples obtained after 18 months and 3 years. The primary endpoint was time to prostate cancer progression, defined as the number of days between the start of study treatment and the earlier of either pathological progression (in patients with ≥1 biopsy assessment after baseline) or therapeutic progression (start of medical therapy). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00363311.

Findings
Between Aug 10, 2006, and March 26, 2007, we randomly allocated 302 participants, of whom 289 (96%) had at least one biopsy procedure after baseline and were included in the primary analysis. By 3 years, 54 (38%) of 144 men in the dutasteride group and 70 (48%) of 145 controls had prostate cancer progression (pathological or therapeutic; hazard ratio 0·62, 95% CI 0·43–0·89; p=0·009). Incidence of adverse events was much the same between treatment groups. 35 (24%) men in the dutasteride group and 23 (15%) controls had sexual adverse events or breast enlargement or tenderness. Eight (5%) men in the dutasteride group and seven (5%) controls had cardiovascular adverse events, but there were no prostate cancer-related deaths or instances of metastatic disease.

Interpretation
Dutasteride could provide a beneficial adjunct to active surveillance for men with low-risk prostate cancer.


Introduction
Prostate cancer accounts for about 25% of newly diagnosed cancers every year in men in the USA.1 Although men's lifetime risk of development of clinical prostate cancer is high (∼16–18%), the corresponding risk of death is only about 3%.2, 3 A study4 of autopsies in men who died after trauma reported histological evidence of prostate cancer in the fourth decade of life, with lesions becoming more widespread in older men. The lengthy natural history of prostate cancer might contribute to overdiagnosis of indolent disease. Patients with small or indolent cancers might receive no benefit from, and could be harmed by, unnecessary treatment of latent disease.4 Modelling studies based on incidence data from the USA5 suggest overdiagnosis rates of 29–44% in all cases detected by prostate-specific antigen screening. In another study,6 the number needed to treat for 10 years to save one life was 48, although this number might become more favourable over time with longer follow-up.
Several studies suggested that localised prostate cancer is often treated too aggressively, despite the low risk of disease-related death.7 Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) system from 2004 to 2006 showed that more than 75% of men with low-risk disease undergo aggressive local therapy.7 Data from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry8 suggest that more than 90% of men with very low-risk disease are actively treated with radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or androgen suppression. However, active surveillance (conservative management or expectant management) for patients diagnosed with low-volume, low-grade prostate cancer, including assessment of cancer progression with regular prostate examination, prostate-specific antigen measurement, and repeat biopsies, can be a more appropriate option for many of these men.9 A population-based cohort study suggested a 10 year cancer-specific survival of 94% in men aged 65–74 years with conservatively managed stage T1 or T2 cancers at diagnosis.10 Furthermore, men with 7–10 year follow-up have a cause-specific survival of 97–100% in large cohort studies.3 Nevertheless, active surveillance is sometimes received with uncertainty by men confronted with treatment decisions for localised disease.8
In men with low-risk, localised prostate cancer, treatment with a 5α-reductase inhibitor might decrease disease progression, extend time to development of aggressive disease, and potentially reduce the need for active therapy. 5α-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, leading to a reduction in prostate volume and a decrease in prostate-specific antigen concentrations.11 Dutasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and is the only 5α-reductase inhibitor that inhibits both isoforms (type 1 and type 2) of 5α-reductase.11 Dutasteride reduced serum dihydrotestosterone by at least 90% in men with localised prostate cancer, a significantly greater reduction (p<0·001) than that reported in men who did not receive dutasteride, and results in a reduction in the volume of some prostate cancers.12 In the 4 year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study,13 dutasteride treatment resulted in a relative risk reduction of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer of 22·8% (95% CI 15·2–29·8) compared with placebo in men who were at increased risk of developing prostate cancer (restricted crude rate). During the 4 years, 437 (13·2%) of 3299 patients in the dutasteride group developed biopsy-detectable cancer with a Gleason scale score of 5–6 compared with 617 (18·1%) of 3407 controls (p<0·001); by contrast, 220 (6·7%) dutasteride-treated patients and 233 (6·8%) controls developed cancer scoring 7–10 on the Gleason scale (p=0·81) and 29 treated patients (0·9%) and 19 controls (0·6%) developed cancer scoring 8–10 on the Gleason scale (p=0·15).
In the reduction by dutasteride of clinical progression events in expectant management (REDEEM) trial, we aimed to assess whether treatment with dutasteride decreased the rate of prostate cancer progression (pathological or therapeutic) compared with placebo in men with low-risk, localised disease who would otherwise undergo active surveillance.
